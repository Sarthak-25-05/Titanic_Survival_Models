🚢 Titanic_Survival_Models

This project is based on the Titanic dataset, one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets in machine learning. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and other available information.

📌Project Overview:
Preprocessed the Titanic dataset (handled missing values, categorical encoding, scaling).
Built three basic machine learning models:
> Logistic Regression
> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
> Random Forest Classifier
Compared their performance using accuracy score.

⚙️ Models & Results
Model	                         Accuracy (approx)
Logistic Regression	               75-85 %
K-Nearest Neighbors	               70-75 %
Random Forest                      80-85 %
