🚢 Titanic_Survival_Models
This is my first data science project where I analyze the Titanic dataset and build models to predict passenger survival.  
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques and compare model performance.


📌Project Overview:
Preprocessed the Titanic dataset (handled missing values, categorical encoding, scaling).
Built three basic machine learning models:
> Logistic Regression
> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
> Random Forest Classifier
Compared their performance using accuracy score.

⚙️ Models & Results
Model	                         Accuracy (approx)
Logistic Regression	               ~79 %
K-Nearest Neighbors	               ~75 %
Random Forest                      ~82 %

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy–        Data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn-  Visualization
Scikit-learn–         Model building & evaluation

 📌 Next Steps
- Try advanced models (XGBoost, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
